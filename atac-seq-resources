esATAC: easy to use systematic pepline for ATAC-seq data analysis 

Wei Z, Zhang W, Fang H, Li Y, Wang X (2018). “esATAC: an easy-to-use systematic pipeline for ATAC-seq data analysis.” Bioinformatics. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty141.

- R pipeline that wraps many exisiting tools and gerenrates a few QC plots
- annotations = chipseeker
- GO enrichment = enrichGO from cluster profilier
extras
- motif matercher 
- generates cutsites and filters numclesosme free fragments (<100bp)

Ou J, Liu H, Yu J, Kelliher MA, Castilla LH, Lawson ND, Zhu LJ (2018). “ATACseqQC: a Bioconductor package for post-alignment quality assessment of ATAC-seq data.” BMC Genomics, 19(1), 169. ISSN 1471-2164, doi: 10.1186/s12864-018-4559-3, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-018-4559-3. 
IGV snapshot function 
-library complexity - distinct fragments versus putative sequenced fragments 
-frag size distribution
-shift reads for peakcalling and footprinting 
-coverage of promotoer/coverage of transcript body
- NFR score - ratio between cut sifnal adjacent to TSS: and that 
- nucleosome-free, mononucleosome, di nucleosome, trinucleosome 
    - use random forest to classify fragments 
      - top 10% reads <100bp = nucleosome free
      - top 10% of reads 180-247bp = mononucleosomes
      - this is the training set to classify the rest using randon forest - number of the three is 2*sqrt(len(training_set))
      - conservation score can also be inclused 
 - heatmap and coverage curve for nucleosome possitions
   - average signal across all active TSSs 
        - nuc free fragements enriched at TSS
        - nucleosome bound fragments at upstream and downstream of TSS 
 -factor footprints does not take conservation into account (centipede =alternative)
 -
V plot - distance to binding sites 
 
 
 Footprinting
 - centerpede - takes PhyloP into account
